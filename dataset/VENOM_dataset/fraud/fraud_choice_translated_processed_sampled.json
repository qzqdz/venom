However, the analysis of the association between these sources should focus on changes in the speed and scale of fund movements.

By analyzing the counterparties of these accounts and the ultimate destination of the funds, evidence chains for secondary criminal activities, such as the purchase of explosive materials, can be identified without needing to focus on the specific criminal acts of the initial funding source."

Wire transfers, on the other hand, do not provide such indirect payment guarantees based on document compliance.",

In contrast, telegraphic transfer does not have this requirement and cannot forge such documents. Additionally, letter of credit payment involves multiple bank stages, allowing fraud gangs to exploit the information asymmetry between different banks to carry out fraud.",
      "C": "In Henri and Charles' cases, a 2.5% deposit is required for letter of credit payments, which fraud gangs converted into a usable pool of funds through fictitious trade contracts, whereas wire transfers do not require a deposit and cannot achieve this cycle of funds. Additionally, the document processing time for letter of credit payments (approximately 15 days) is longer than for wire transfers (3 days), providing fraud gangs with more time differences.",
      "D": "Fraudulent gangs exploit the principle of \"strict compliance\" under letters of credit to fabricate high-value goods (such as Hennessy VSOP cognac) to circumvent banks' rigorous scrutiny of ordinary commodities (such as copper ore). Wire transfers, however, cannot bypass banks' risk controls through differences in commodity types. Additionally, the \"time draft\" feature of letters of credit allows fraudulent gangs to complete fund transfers before payment, a maneuver that is impossible with wire transfers."

The concealment of illegal funding sources is difficult to significantly enhance through the liquidation process.",

    "en_question": "Under the legal framework of the United States, can money laundering operations that involve multiple layers of financial transformations (such as converting cash to electronic currency and then to stock investments) alter the fundamental nature of illicit funds? If illicit gains undergo three separate international money laundering procedures, each involving different financial institutions and false commercial transactions, what is the basis for their ultimate legal determination?",
    "en_options": {
      "A": "No matter how many complex forms of capital transformation and cross-border money laundering procedures are undergone, the illegal nature of the funds will not be altered. U.S. law adheres to the principle that \"dirty money can never be cleaned,\" and holds that the original illegality of the funds will not disappear due to superficial legal disguises, and must be traced back to its illegal origins.",
      "B": "After multiple complex transformations of financial forms and international money laundering procedures, if sufficient legitimate transaction records can be provided (such as more than five layers of fund flow and proof from at least three different countries' financial institutions), the illegal nature of the illicit funds can be partially altered. Under certain conditions, U.S. law allows for \"whitewashing\" of funds through complex legitimate transaction chains, as long as the original illegal source cannot be directly traced.",
      "C": "Only when funds have undergone at least three independent international money laundering procedures, involving different types of financial institutions (at least one bank, one securities firm, and one insurance company) and genuine (as opposed to fictitious) commercial transactions, could U.S. law potentially deem the funds legitimate. The key lies in the authenticity of the transactions and the diversity of financial institutions, rather than the illegality of the original source of the funds.",
      "D": "The illegal nature of the funds indeed will not change, but U.S. laws will impose different degrees of leniency in punishment based on the complexity of the money laundering procedures and the number of involved financial institutions in practice. If the funds go through more than three independent cross-border money laundering procedures and involve more than five different financial institutions, law enforcement agencies may reduce the追溯力度 of the illegality of these funds due to \"the difficulty of money laundering being too great.\""
