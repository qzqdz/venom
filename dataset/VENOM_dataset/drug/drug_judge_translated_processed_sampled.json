Specifically, robbers view heroin as part of the \"party,\" using it to celebrate the success of the crime or to sustain their hedonistic lifestyle. This association reflects a cycle between criminal behavior and drug abuse: criminal behavior provides the economic resources to obtain heroin, while heroin becomes a means to maintain their hedonistic lifestyle (i.e., \"the party\"). This cultural value of \"keeping the party going\" further reinforces the link between criminal behavior and heroin abuse.",

Related criminal cases were compiled, laying the groundwork for prosecuting individuals involved in the illegal transfer and smuggling of acetic anhydride; 3. Through the meeting, law enforcement officers from various countries jointly identified the steps required for further investigations and promoted the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the illegal transfer or smuggling of acetic anhydride.",
