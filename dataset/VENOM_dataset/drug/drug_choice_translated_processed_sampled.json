This is because a 48% concentration of hydrobromic acid provides sufficient reactivity to promote the key electrophilic substitution reaction. However, a 48% concentration does not prevent the formation of副产物, as even at 48% concentration, hydrobromic acid can still over-release hydrogen bromide, leading to reaction失控 or the formation of hazardous副产物."

Unlike methylamine in its gaseous form, which requires special pressure vessels to maintain stability, the solid form does not need such containers, reducing the complexity and potential risks during transportation. Therefore, the chloride salt form of methylamine is more convenient to handle and transport due to its solid state. During transportation, special attention must also be paid to preventing heating and impacts to avoid the salt form converting to a gaseous state, thereby reducing transportation safety risks.",
      "B": "The chloride form of methylamine does not require special protective measures during transportation, as this form of methylamine is a stable liquid at room temperature and normal pressure and does not need special containers. The main safety consideration is to avoid contact with air during storage to prevent oxidation reactions.",
